# What is our vision ?

We would like to make a complete course set for major Computer Science, which is definitely a long journey. We plan to start with

* Network technology
* AI
* Programming language

We will make online courses and offline training, including video, gitbook, source code. The best of those courses is that it is designed for combining theory and practice, not only for teaching the course itself, more importantly, for forming the student scientific method and critical thinking.
